# Cell_locator
Basic app to get location name from connected GSM cell tower ID (assign custom location name to connected cell tower ID) for MRE platform mobile phone (including Nokia S30+). VM_KEY_OK - refresh, VM_KEY_RIGHT_SOFTKEY - exit app, VM_KEY_LEFT_SOFTKEY - rename current place, VM_KEY_STAR - switch displaying: Name/LAC:CID. Location name list: "cell_locator.txt" on same directory as app "cell_locator.vxp" (if change vxp name, change list file name to). New location name filled to list automatically as detected on starting program or with refreshing button. Tested on Nokia 225 with display resolution 240x320. For using with Nokia mobile phone, app must be signed with IMSI (your SIM card) code.
